Need to find how many 5s there are as factor of n!
10 is the product of 2 and 5. In n!, we need to know how many 2 and 5, and the number of zeros is the minimum of the number of 2 and the number of 5.
Since multiple of 2 is more than multiple of 5, the number of zeros is dominant by the number of 5. 
Sometimes one number may have several 5 factors, for example, 25 have two 5 factors, 125 have three 5 factors.

This solution uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) :
- if n<3 then the number of primes is 0 (0 and 1 are not primes)
- create an array of boolean of length n
- initialize the count of primes to n-2 (initially we consider all primes except for 0 and 1 that we already said are not primes)
- starting from int i=2 take this number as the smallest prime
- mark all multiples of i smaller than n as not prime. Every time an element is marked as true (that indicates is not a prime), decrement the prime count (count--).
- take the next i in the sequence that is not marked and repeat the process from point 5.
- at the end we will have in the count variable the number of primes (the number of elements that are not marked in the inner loop).
